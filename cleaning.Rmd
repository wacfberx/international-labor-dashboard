## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# importing required packages
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)

# Tab names as a list
sheet_names <- excel_sheets("Labor Force.xls")
sheet_names <- sheet_names[-c(1,2,3,4)]

list_all <- lapply(sheet_names, function(x) {
  as.data.frame(read_excel("Labor Force.xls", sheet = x, skip = 2))
})

names(list_all) <- sheet_names

# Bind things togehter once cleaned and added stat label
labor_practice <- do.call("rbind.data.frame", list_all)

blank_columns <- seq(from = 3, to = 31, by = 2)

labor_practice <- labor_practice %>%
  mutate(across(!group, as.numeric)) %>%
  select(-c(blank_columns))
  
```

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

df2 <- labor_practice %>% 
  filter(group %in% c("Employment-population ratios for men", 
                      "employment-population ratios for women",
                      "Labor force participation rates for men", 
                      "labor force participation rates for women",
                      "Unemployment rates for men",
                      "unemployment rates for women",
                      "working-age population for men", 
                      "Working-age population for women")) %>%
